# blipsCLI
Use Blips from the command line!

# Caveats/Roadmap
*Not yet implemented features include, but are not limited to:*
- Viewing statuses
- Liking statuses
- Replying to people/mentions
- Direct messages (Soon. Maybe)

# Installation
You should have Python 3.8 or higher, and:
- The requests package
- The argparse package
- A working Internet connection

Download blipsCLI and then put it wherever you *think* you're going to use it.

Edit the fields `username` and `password` in the file.
